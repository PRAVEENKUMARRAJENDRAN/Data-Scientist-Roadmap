# 📊 Data Scientist Transition Roadmap (1 Year)

This roadmap is designed for a **Data Engineer transitioning to Data Scientist** in 1 year. It balances **daily practice**, **weekly mini-projects**, and **monthly capstones** while keeping learning interesting and project-driven.

---

## 📅 Structure
- **Daily Practice** → 30–60 mins (coding, stats, ML problems)
- **Weekly Mini-Project** → 2–3 hrs hands-on
- **Monthly Capstone** → Larger project consolidating skills
- **Final 3 months** → Full interview prep (case studies, ML design, SQL, Python, mock interviews)

---

## 🚀 Month 1–2: Foundations (Statistics + Python for DS)
**Goal:** Build strong foundations in probability, statistics, and Python.

### Daily
- Solve 1 stats/DS problem (mean, variance, probability puzzles)
- Python/Pandas/Numpy practice

### Weekly Mini-Projects
- 📊 EDA on Kaggle dataset (Titanic, Netflix, etc.)
- 🎲 Probability simulation in Python (dice, coin flips, Monty Hall)
- 🧹 Data wrangling project (clean messy CSV, missing values)
- 📈 Visualization project (Matplotlib, Seaborn dashboards)

---

## 🤖 Month 3–4: Machine Learning (Supervised + Unsupervised)
**Goal:** Learn ML algorithms intuitively and practically.

### Daily
- Algorithm deep dive (Linear Regression, Trees, Clustering)
- ML coding with Scikit-learn

### Weekly Mini-Projects
- 🏡 House price prediction (Regression)
- 📧 Spam classifier (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- 👥 Customer segmentation (K-means)
- 🎥 Movie recommender (Collaborative Filtering)

---

## ⚡ Month 5–6: Advanced ML + Feature Engineering
**Goal:** Master ensemble methods, feature engineering, evaluation metrics.

### Daily
- Practice feature engineering
- Learn Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Study evaluation metrics (AUC, F1, Precision/Recall)

### Weekly Mini-Projects
- 💳 Fraud detection (imbalanced data)
- 🏦 Credit score prediction (Ensemble)
- 🔎 Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- 🏆 Kaggle beginner competition

---

## 🧠 Month 7–8: Deep Learning + NLP
**Goal:** Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.

### Daily
- TensorFlow/PyTorch exercises
- Implement small NN models

### Weekly Mini-Projects
- 🔢 Digit recognition (MNIST with CNN)
- 💬 Sentiment analysis (Twitter dataset)
- 🖼️ Image classification (CIFAR-10)
- 📑 Text summarization (BERT, GPT)

---

## 🌍 Month 9: Real-World ML Pipelines
**Goal:** End-to-end DS workflows with deployment.

### Weekly Mini-Projects
- 📈 Stock price predictor (Time-series)
- 🎯 Recommendation system with embeddings
- 🚀 Deploy ML model (FastAPI + Docker)
- ⚙️ ML pipeline automation (Airflow)

---

## 💼 Month 10: Business + Case Studies
**Goal:** Think like a Data Scientist in interviews.

### Daily
- Solve 1 case study/business problem (A/B testing, churn)

### Weekly
- ✍️ Write blog-style case study on LinkedIn/GitHub

---

## 📝 Month 11–12: Interview Prep & Mock Practice
**Goal:** Be interview-ready.

### Daily
- SQL + Python LeetCode (easy/medium)
- ML/Stats revision
- 1 case study

### Weekly
- 🎤 Mock interviews (peers or platforms)
- 📂 End-to-end project presentation (portfolio defense)

---

## ✅ Deliverables After 1 Year
- 12+ weekly projects
- 4–6 monthly capstones
- GitHub portfolio with notebooks + README
- (Optional) Blog posts
- Interview readiness (stats, ML, SQL, case studies, ML design)

---
